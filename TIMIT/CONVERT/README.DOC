This software is intended to convert the DARPA TIMIT CD-ROM (CD 1-1.1)
Continuous Speech Database files into the European Multi-lingual Speech
input/output Assessment Methodology and Standardization (SAM) speech database
format.  

It was made in cooperation with the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) (U.S.A) and the E.E.C. European Strategic Project on
Information Technology (ESPRIT) Project No. 2589 (SAM). Implementation was
carried out at the Institut de la Communication Parl‚e, Grenoble, France. 
(Some minor revisions were made at NIST to the original SAM source code so that
the software would work with the TIMIT CD-ROM file structure.)

The NIST TIMIT speech file format is composed of a header which is 1024-byte
long, followed by the sampled speech.  The header contains information
about the file production.  Some of this information is used by the CONVERT
software.

An example of the DARPA TIMIT CD-ROM filenaming convention is:

                       \TIMIT\TRAIN\DR1\FCJF0\SA1.WAV
        



                    where     TIMIT: is the database identifier
                              TRAIN: is the usage directory
                                DR1: is the dialect region directory
                              FCJF0: is the sex/speaker identifier directory
                            SA1.WAV: is speech waveform file for the sentence-
                                     text, "sa1"
                 
                          with CJF0: speaker code (4 positions)
                                  1: dialect region code
                                SA1: sentence code
                                WAV: means WAVeform


The SAM speech file format consists only of sampled speech.  However, a label
file containing relevant information is associated with every speech file. 
The SAM naming convention is:

                           XXnnxxxx.SAS   <->   XXnnxxxx.SAO
        
                    where  XXnnxxxx.SAS: is the speech waveform file
                    and    XXnnxxxx.SAO: is the associated label file

                    with       XX: speaker code (2 positions)
                               nn: corpus code (2 positions)
                             xxxx: unique file number (4 positions)
                                S: means Sentence
                                A: means American
                                S: means Sampled speech
                                O: means Orthographic time-aligned labelling


A mapping file has been included by NIST on the present CD-ROM, to be used
when the CD-ROM is on line and when the filename conversion is automatic
(i.e., with the command file).  [The use of this mapping file ensures that
a unique speaker code is generated for each speaker.]

        SPKR_MAP.SAM: contains a conversion map which assigns a unique "SAM"
                      code to each (American) speaker in the DARPA TIMIT/
                      Resource Management corpus.  This code is used in the 
                      SAM filename produced as XX. [This file is found in
                      \CONVERT\]

        The two first letters of the original filename are used as the
        (corpus code) in the filename that is produced:   SA1 --> SA


Each recording lab in the SAM project is allocated a batch of codes or
numbers to ensure the nnxxxx field specifies a unique recorded file for each
language [laboratory].

NOTE: ONE DARPA TIMIT file will be converted into TWO associated SAM files, 
(i.e., one ".WAV" file will be converted into one "SAS" and one "SAO" file).  

The user is asked to first give the CD-ROM drive letter, the speaker
information file specification [\TIMIT\DOC\SPKRINFO.TXT] and text prompts file
specification [this should be left blank so that the program uses the 
transcriptions instead of the prompts], in order to ensure that information
can be read from the CD-ROM disc when present.  The CD-ROM making date
will calculate the speakers' ages (at the time of recording) from the speaker 
information file [this should also be blank because the speaker age will be 
calculated automatically from the "SPKRINFO.TXT" file]



How to run CONVERT:
------------------
        Convert can be invoked two ways:

         (1)    > convert

         (2)    > convert myfile      (where "myfile" is the name of the
                                       command file)


(1) In this case, the user has to answer some questions and, in particular,
to give, each time he wants to convert another file, its full name and
pathname. This method is useful for a single conversion.

(2) The files listed in the command file are converted according to the SAM
filenaming convention.

If the CD-ROM is present, the speaker code is read from the [\TIMIT\DOC]
SPKR_MAP.SAM file (conversion map).

If the CD_ROM is not present, the user will be asked to specify a speaker
mapping file.  The speaker code will either be derived from the mapping file
(if specified), or will be composed of the two first letters of the American
speaker code [which will not necessarily produce a unique speaker code].

The speaker is always asked for the number of the file first produced by
CONVERT.  Then the file number will be incremented before every new
conversion.

This method is useful for converting batches of files.

In both cases, the CD-ROM disc may be present or not.  If it is, more
information can be read, and the associated label file that is produced will
be more complete, (particularly the sentence text prompt and the speaker
information).

How to write a command file:
---------------------------
A command file is easily written using a text editor according to the
following rules:

     - one filename per line

          <FILENAME><NEW-LINE>
       or <PATHNAME>\<FILENAME><NEW-LINE>

     - the pathname is valid until a new one is set.


    Example command files
    ---------------------

    Example 1:

        SA1.WAV
        SA2.WAV
        SX100.WAV
        
        ----> These three files (in the current directory) will be converted.

        --------------

     Example 2:

        K:\TIMIT\TRAIN\DR5\MJPG0\SA1.WAV
        SI1191.WAV
        SX291.WAV
        K:\TIMIT\TEST\DR1\FAKS0\SI2203.WAV
        

        ----> The first three files (in the CD-ROM directory 
        \TIMIT\TRAIN\DR5\MJPG0 will be converted followed by the file in the  
        \TIMIT\TEST\DR1\FAKS0 directory. [K signifies the CD-ROM disc drive 
        letter]
